# Primordial-Particle-System
All Particles follow a simple equation of motion:
delta_phi = alpha + beta*n_t*Math.signum(r_t - l_t);

n_t is number of neighboring particles. r_t is number of neighboring particles on the right and l_t is neighboring particles on the left. Color is determined by density of particles.
